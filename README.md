# Excel-Myntra-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis on Myntra dataset and represented using pivot tables and interactive dashboard


In this data analysis project, I undertook a comprehensive approach to enhance and visualize the Myntra real-time dataset. The key steps involved in the process were as follows:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

1. Removed Unwanted Columns: I meticulously reviewed the dataset to identify and eliminate irrelevant columns like size, discounted amount that did not contribute to the analysis objectives. This step streamlined the dataset, focusing on the most pertinent data.

2. Data Cleaning: Addressed inconsistencies, missing values, and errors within the dataset. This involved standardizing data formats, correcting inaccuracies, and filling in or removing incomplete records to ensure the dataset's integrity.

Data Analysis:

Pivot Tables Creation: Developed pivot tables to summarize and analyze key metrics. This allowed for the aggregation of data across various dimensions such as product categories, sales performance, and customer demographics, providing insightful summaries and trends.
   
Interactive Dashboard:

Dashboard Development: Created an interactive dashboard to visualize real-time data. This dashboard includes dynamic charts, filters, and visualizations that enable users to interact with the dataset, facilitating real-time insights and decision-making.
Visualization: Implemented various types of visualizations such as bar charts, column chart to effectively communicate the data trends and patterns.

Overall, this project aimed to deliver a clean, organized, and insightful view of the Myntra dataset through advanced analysis and interactive visualization techniques. The resulting dashboard offers a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing real-time data, supporting data-driven decision-making processes.
